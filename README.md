### Continued development

I need to mess around more with card components and formatting those. Css is such a new concept for me, it's hard to know where to begin at times.

## Acknowledgments

I couldn't have done this without his css file. I got some of the basics like fonts, colors but formatting and placing is still hard for me to figure out. I read through his code and google searched a lot to know what it did and I have learned a ton. So I literally couldn't have finished this or learned so much without his code.
